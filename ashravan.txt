[This is a placeholder for the Brandon Sanderson short story about Ashravan after Shai restores him.]

Ashravan opened his eyes, the world around him a blur of colors and sounds. Shai's touch had been gentle, but the aftermath of her magic left a lingering tension in his body. As he sat up, he realized that his powers felt different—more stable, yet tinged with a strange new strength.

He looked around, memories flooding back—the betrayal, the rescue, the battles fought in shadows. Now, standing here in the quiet aftermath, he felt a surge of determination. The world was vulnerable, and he was reborn not just as a warrior, but as a guardian.

Suddenly, distant screams shattered the silence. Ashravan's heart pounded. He knew what he had to do. With renewed purpose, he set out to face the darkness that threatened to engulf his homeland. This time, he would be the shield that others relied upon, the hope that never fades.

The climax approached as he confronted the malevolent force, a battle of wills and strength. With Shai's magic coursing through him, Ashravan stood tall, ready to carve his destiny into the annals of history.
